this problem is 90%pen paper and 10%code

basically think about it
lcm/gcd =< 3

and 1 <= a, b <= n

see gcd can be 1, 2, 3
 
so if lcm/gcd = 1
lcm = gcd
only iff numbers are same

lcm/gcd =2
lcm = 2gcd
meaning that lcm(a, 2a) is obviously 2a
and same with gcd(a, 2a) is obviosuly a

same could be applied to 3
 
so basically
(1,1) (2,2) ....... (n, n)
(1, 2) (2, 4) ....... ( n/2, n)
(1, 3) (2, 6) .... (n/3, n)

we will also do it reverse
(2, 1) (4, 2);.... so two times 
`n pair, (n/2)*2 and (n/3)*2`
