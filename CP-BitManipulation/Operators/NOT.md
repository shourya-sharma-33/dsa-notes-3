~1=0
~0=1

basically this
for a signed number 
we take an extra bit to represent the sign

x = 0 00000000000000000000000000010110

1's complement is flipping every bit
2's complement is 1's complement + 1

17 = 10001
-17 = 01111 (twos complement)

~x = 1 1111111111111111111111111101001
this is -21

(~n) = -(n+1)
