1,1,2,3,3,4,4

there are 4 

one is we can iterarte
we iterate  and than we run an inner loop
(chatgpt write this)

and than we can also
have a hash map and and i store frequency

psuedo code for

we run a loop to find the size of array
we make a hashap
we loop and save frequencies
finally reloop to get the frequencey

but hash has isues with negetive numbers, we can use maps with long long

even after all that the time complexity is 3n

now we will use xor for this

0 xor 2 = 2
1 xor 1 = 0
1 xor 1 xor 2 xor 3 xor 3 = 2
simple good boy

```cpp
int function(vector<int> &arr)
{
    int xor = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i<arr.size(); i++)
    {
        xor = xor ^ arr[i];
    }
    return xor;
}
```
