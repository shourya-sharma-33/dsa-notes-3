logic is thiss

m is prime n is prime
m + n mustnt be prime

we are given n and we have to find m

the n will be 7
why so u may wonder?

this works with any prime number
2 + 7 = 9  
3+7= 10

simple logic
odd + odd is even
and except 2 every even number is not prime
then why we didnt add it with like 3 or 5?

well because 2 + 3 = 5
2 + 5 = 7


```cpp
void solve(){
    int n;
    cin>> n;
    cout<<"7\n";
}
```
